# MyResume

- Input  
The input includes static data, like your name, address, education, skills, and project details, all hardcoded in the program. It also uses a CSS file (Resume.css) to make the resume look nice and polished. At this point, the input is all set by the developer, with no user interaction involved.  

- Process  
The program takes the static input and organizes it into neat sections using Reactâ€™s JSX syntax, like splitting it into education, skills, and projects. These sections are wrapped in `<div>` and `<section>` tags to keep things tidy and easy to read. React handles rendering this setup into the virtual DOM, while the Resume.css file adds the styling to make everything look good.  

- Output  
The output is a clean and professional-looking resume webpage that shows your personal info, like your name, contact details, education, and skills.
